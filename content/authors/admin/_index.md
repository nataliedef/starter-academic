I am a Biomedical Sciences / Bioinformatics PhD Candidate at University of California (UC) San Diego. My research integrates high-throughput genomic screens and large-scale human genetic datasets to identify and evaluate novel therapeutic targets for prevalent metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
