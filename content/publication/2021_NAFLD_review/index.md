abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a continuous progression of pathophysiologic stages that is challenging to diagnose due to its inherent heterogeneity and poor standardization across a wide variety of diagnostic measures. NAFLD is heritable, and several loci have been robustly associated with various stages of disease. In the past few years, larger genetic association studies using new methodology have identified novel genes associated with NAFLD, some of which have shown therapeutic promise. This mini-review provides an overview of the heterogeneity in NAFLD phenotypes and diagnostic methods, discusses genetic associations in relation to the specific stages for which they were identified, and offers a perspective on the design of future genetic mapping studies to accelerate therapeutic target identification.
